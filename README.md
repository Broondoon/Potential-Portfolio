# Potential-Portfolio
It's no longer potential - this is now actually my portfolio!
Starting off small, there are currently three different code samples to view.

# Math Function Calculator
This is a program written as part of a job application assignment. When given a function or multiple nested functions, the program will apply the functions given.
At the time of writing it, one of my classes was teaching "Regex", a method of using regular expressions in Python to parse strings. Coincidentally, regular expressions were a perfect fit for this assignment, so I used them here.
It currently has only two functions, "add" and "multiply", but could easily be changed to include more. Any function only accepts two inputs, however it is a simple matter to allow infinite inputs for any given function.

# Non-Graphical Histogram
A program written for a university assignment. When given a text file, it generates a histogram of how often certain word lengths appear in the file.
I've also included a few sample text files to demonstrate what I mean.

# Unity Fan-Game
I am currently working on a personal project of mine in Unity. As an example of this, I've uploaded a script called "PlayerManager.cs".
PlayerManager is a simple player controller script which manages player movement, pushing objects and initiating dialogue. The game works on a simple 2D grid, where most gameplay is in dialogue sequences or puzzle segments, so nothing too complicated was needed.
